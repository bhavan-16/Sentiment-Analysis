This project is a Sentiment Analysis application that uses a fine-tuned Transformer model (BERT) to classify text into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment.
The app is built using Streamlit for the frontend, PyTorch for model inference, and Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers for NLP.
It provides a clean, interactive UI with animated background and highlights predictions with glowing borders for easy visualization.
